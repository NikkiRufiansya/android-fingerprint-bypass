# android-fingerprint-bypass

Updated Android biometric bypass script (from Kamil Bre≈Ñski, Krzysztof Pranczk and Mateusz Fruba, August 2019).

This script will bypass authentication when the crypto object is not used. The authentication implementation relies on the callback onAuthenticationSucceded being called.

:new: The code resolves `BiometricPrompt$AuthenticationResult` constructor args at runtime. :new: 

It should work with any Android version.

## Usage

```
$ frida --codeshare ax/universal-android-biometric-bypass -f YOUR_BINARY
```
